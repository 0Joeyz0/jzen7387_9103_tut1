## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I find "surrealist" imaging techniques in photography very inspiring for my assignment. Among them, its "double exposure" technology combines two different images into one picture, creating a dreamy and surreal visual effect, which is very attractive to me. I would like to incorporate this technique into my assignments to add depth and symbolism to my images. By blending two different visuals, I can convey complex meaning or emotion in my assignments beyond what a single image can achieve.
