## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Pointillism**

I found the imaging techniques of "Pointillism" in artworks very inspiring for my assignment. This technique captures a high degree of textural detail as well as vibrant colors, using short and broken brushstrokes to convey changes in light, color and atmosphere, providing a visually captivating and unique way of creating images. This imaging technique, where individual color dots are carefully placed to form a cohesive image, is not only visually appealing but also fun to explore. I hope to incorporate this technique into my assignments to provide interesting and visually appealing presentations. And it can bridge the gap between art and technology, showing how coding can be used to replicate the techniques of traditional art.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To implement the above-mentioned "pointillism" imaging techniques, Python with the Pillow library is a good choice. This encoding technique places color dots (pixels) in precise locations, and by manipulating the color and position of each pixel, I can imitate the detailed and vibrant compositional characteristics of Pointillism paintings.
