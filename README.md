## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Pointillism**

I found the imaging techniques of "Pointillism" in artworks very inspiring for my assignment. This technique uniquely captures a sense of depth, texture, and vibrant color, using short, broken brushstrokes to convey changes in light, color, and atmosphere. I love this imaging technique of carefully placing individual points of color to form a cohesive image, and wanted to incorporate this technique into my assignments to provide an interesting and visually appealing presentation.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To implement the above-mentioned "pointillism" imaging techniques, Python with the Pillow library is a good choice. This encoding technique places color dots (pixels) in precise locations, and by manipulating the color and position of each pixel, I can imitate the detailed and vibrant compositional characteristics of Pointillism paintings.
