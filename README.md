## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I find "surrealism" imaging techniques in photography very inspiring for my assignment. Among them, its "double exposure" technology combines two different images into one picture, creating a dreamy and surreal visual effect, which is very attractive to me. I would like to incorporate this technique into my assignments to add depth and symbolism to my images. By blending two different visuals, I can convey complex meaning or emotion in my assignments beyond what a single image can achieve.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

In order to realize the above-mentioned "surrealism" imaging technology, the coding technology of image mixing and synthesis can be used. Use image processing libraries like OpenCV and programming languages like Python to layer two or more images together and control their transparency to create fantastic visual effects. I can use blending modes such as Overlay, Difference, and Color Burn to adjust how the image blends.
